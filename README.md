# Legend of the ball âœ¨
This is a Unity 3D game based on the [Roll a ball tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball).

## Built with :hammer:
- Unity
- C#

## Information and features :books:
- This little game was developed following the Roll a ball tutorial.
- After learning the basics, I implemented a few other features, such as:
    - A **main menu**!
    - **Jumping!** 
    - **Bouncy surfaces**!
    - **Game over** screen! (Oops, you died. But don't worry, you may continue playing from the same level you fell off!)
    - **Change of scenes**: The main menu takes you to the **Level 1** screen. By picking the **magic pill** you may adventure to **Level 2**. If death takes you, you'll get to the magic realm of **Game over**. If you win, you may **play again**!
    - **Music**! Two different variants of the same theme play in the main menu and the rest of the screens.
    - Now presenting: the **ESCAPE key** and the revolutionary **Exit** feature! Want to return to the menu screen? Just press the ESC key any time. Want to exit the game? Press the Exit button on the main screen.

- Reach the end of the level and pick the magic pill
- Experiment combining your jumps at the right moment with the bounciness of the yellow tiles to reach higher and further! See how the physics change when passing through them and how they can help you to win the game. 

### **Level 2**

- Pick all the magic cubes (12 in total) to win. (It's not that easy!) The count will update on the top left corner.

### **Game over**

- If you fall, the game ends. You may try again starting from the level you died.

**Good luck!**
