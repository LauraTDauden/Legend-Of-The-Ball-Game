## Information and features :books:
- This little game was developed following the Roll a ball tutorial.
- After learning the basics, I implemented a few other features, such as:
    - A **main menu**!
    - **Jumping!** (See how our little ball jumps)
    - **Bouncy surfaces**! (See how the physics change when passing through them and experiment how high you can go by jumping at the right moment)
    - **Game over** screen! (Oops, you died. But don't worry, you may continue playing on the same level you fell off!)
    - **Change of scenes**: The main menu takes you to the **Level 1** screen. By picking the **magic pill** you may adventure to **Level 2**. If death takes you, you'll get to the magic realm of **Game over**. If you win, you may **play again**!
    - **Music**! Two different variants of the same theme play in the main menu and the rest of the screens.
